        "We built FieldCamp from scratch with modern technology, which is more efficient and less expensive to maintain than legacy systems. We pass those savings to you. Plus, we believe in transparent pricing—one price, all features included. No nickel-and-diming like HouseCall Pro's add-on model."

      title: "How does FieldCamp's pricing compare?", 
      content: [
        "FieldCamp: $39-59 per user, everything included. HouseCall Pro: $69+ per user for basic features, plus setup fees, plus higher payment processing rates. For a 10-person team, you'll save $300-400 monthly while getting more features."

    { 
      title: "Can I switch from HouseCall Pro easily?", 
      content: [
        "We handle the entire migration—customer data, job history, and open invoices transfer in about 24 hours. You can run both systems in parallel while your team gets comfortable. Most companies are fully switched within a week, with free onboarding support throughout."

      title: "Does FieldCamp have a mobile app?", 
      content: [
        "Yes, our mobile app works on iOS and Android. It's built for field conditions—big buttons, fast loading, works great even with poor signal. Techs can view schedules, update job status, capture signatures, and process payments from their phones."
      ]

    { 
      title: "What about QuickBooks integration?", 
      content: [
        "FieldCamp syncs bidirectionally with QuickBooks in real-time. But here's the difference—we handle complex scenarios like progress billing, job costing, and inventory sync. It's not just moving invoices; it's maintaining your complete financial workflow."
      ]
    },
    { 
      title: "Why doesn't HouseCall Pro have inventory management?", 
      content: [
        "They'd rather sell you another subscription for a separate inventory app. HouseCall Pro follows the old model of separate tools for everything. FieldCamp believes inventory tracking is essential to field service, so it's built in and included."

    { 
      title: "What if I'm locked into a HouseCall Pro contract?", 
      content: [
        "Many companies switch anyway because the savings and efficiency gains outweigh any early termination fees. We can help you calculate the ROI. Often, you'll save more in 2-3 months than any cancellation penalty."
      ]

      title: "Is FieldCamp really that much better?", 
      content: [
        "The main advantages are features HouseCall Pro simply doesn't have (AI scheduling, inventory tracking, route optimization) plus transparent pricing that doesn't punish growth. Whether that's 'better' depends on your needs. Try it free for 14 days and see the difference yourself."

You're paying premium prices for basic software. FieldCamp gives you twice the features for half the cost – that's why 10,000+ contractors switched this year."

It's more of a scheduling tool with a contact list. FieldCamp includes full CRM capabilities plus AI that actually helps you grow customer relationships."

No route optimization. No inventory tracking. It's like upgrading from a flip phone to an iPhone 6 while everyone else has the iPhone 15."
